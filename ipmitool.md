I saw senior colleague using command about ipmitool.... on shell to check maybe status on something with TE (Test Engineer) in the Fab today. What do you think they might do?

Great observation! Let's break this down step-by-step to understand what your senior colleague was likely doing and what `ipmitool` is used for.

## üîß What Is `ipmitool`?

[ipmitool/ipmitool GitHub repo](https://github.com/ipmitool/ipmitool) is the official open-source CLI tool for **IPMI** (Intelligent Platform Management Interface).

### ‚úÖ **IPMI is a low-level interface** used to manage servers **independently of the OS**, often over a dedicated management port (e.g., BMC/IPMI port).

`ipmitool` lets you:

* Power on/off/reset servers remotely
* Check sensor values (temperature, fan speed, voltage)
* Monitor hardware health
* View SEL (System Event Log)
* Manage user access on the BMC
* Set boot devices (e.g., PXE, disk)

It's **widely used in datacenters**, server manufacturing, and validation labs ‚Äî exactly where you'd see a **TE (Test Engineer)** and RD use it during hardware bring-up or validation.

## üß™ What Your Senior Colleague Might Be Doing with `ipmitool` + TE:

In a Fab or production line, here are common use cases:

### 1. **Hardware Health Check**

```bash
ipmitool sensor
```

‚û° Shows real-time data: CPU temperature, fan RPM, voltages, PSU status

---

### 2. **System Event Log (SEL) Review**

```bash
ipmitool sel list
```

‚û° Shows hardware errors or warnings logged by BMC (e.g., thermal trip, fan failure)

---

### 3. **Remote Server Control**

```bash
ipmitool power status
ipmitool power cycle
```

‚û° Used to remotely reboot or power cycle a system during stress or aging tests

---

### 4. **Setting Boot Devices (PXE / Disk)**

```bash
ipmitool chassis bootdev pxe
```

‚û° Automatically boot servers into PXE to run factory testing OS/images

---

### 5. **Check BMC or FRU Info**

```bash
ipmitool fru
```

‚û° Gets component serials, model numbers ‚Äî used to validate BOM correctness

---

## üîç Why TE Would Use This in a Fab:

* **Automated hardware validation**
* **Failure analysis**
* **Production test debugging**
* **Environmental stress tests (e.g., thermal chambers)**
* **Factory pre-shipment inspection**

---

## üß† Summary

Your senior likely used `ipmitool` in the Fab to **check server hardware status** or **interact with the BMC** during production-level testing.

This aligns with your current job scope (developing diagnostic tools & test automation). Knowing `ipmitool` will be a **very practical skill** in your team.

## ‚úÖ Want to Try It Yourself?

You can simulate some `ipmitool` commands in a local test VM with OpenBMC or test against a physical server with IPMI support.

Let me know if you'd like a safe test environment setup guide or cheat sheet.
