### âœ… **Core Concepts**

* **Git workflow** = a set of rules and branching strategies for team collaboration in Git.
* Choosing the right workflow depends on **team size**, **release frequency**, and **comfort with Git**.

---

### ðŸ”„ **Common Git Workflows**

1. **Centralized Workflow**

   * Single `main` branch.
   * Simple, familiar (like SVN).
   * Best for small teams or Git beginners.

2. **Feature Branch Workflow**

   * Each feature gets its own branch.
   * Encourages clean, testable `main`.
   * Supports pull requests and code reviews.

3. **Gitflow Workflow**

   * Structured branching: `main`, `develop`, `release`, `hotfix`, `feature`.
   * Suits larger teams and defined release cycles.
   * Can be complex to manage.

4. **Forking Workflow**

   * Every contributor forks the main repo.
   * Great for open-source and distributed teams.
   * Promotes safe experimentation and external contributions.

### ðŸ“Œ **Best Practices**

* Keep branches **short-lived** to avoid merge headaches.
* Use **pull requests** to enable reviews and feedback.
* Choose a workflow that matches your **teamâ€™s habits** and **release rhythm**.
* Avoid unnecessary complexityâ€”**simpler is better** unless your project demands more structure.
