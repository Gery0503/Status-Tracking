If you’re starting from zero and want to learn investments with a professional mindset, the best way is to build **a layered foundation** — from basic financial literacy to actual portfolio practice. I’ll give you a structured roadmap that mirrors how professional asset managers train new analysts:

---

## **Step 1: Build Core Financial Literacy** *(2–4 weeks)*

Before touching real money, understand the language of investing.

**Learn:**

* **Basic terminology** — stock, bond, ETF, index fund, market cap, P/E ratio, dividend, volatility.
* **How markets work** — primary vs. secondary markets, exchanges, brokers.
* **Types of assets** — equities, fixed income, commodities, REITs, cash equivalents.

**Free resources:**

* *Investopedia* — definitions & tutorials.
* *Khan Academy Finance & Capital Markets* — beginner-friendly video lessons.
* Read: *The Little Book of Common Sense Investing* by John C. Bogle.

---

## **Step 2: Understand Risk & Strategy** *(2–3 weeks)*

Professionals focus on **risk management before profit**.

**Key concepts:**

* **Risk tolerance** — emotional + financial capacity to handle losses.
* **Diversification** — spreading risk across sectors and assets.
* **Time horizon** — short-term trading vs. long-term investing.
* **Compounding** — why early investing is powerful.

**Exercise:**

* Pick 5 companies you like and track their price movements for 2 weeks — write down **why** they move (earnings, news, macro events).

---

## **Step 3: Learn to Read Financial Statements** *(3–4 weeks)*

If you want to invest like a pro, you must understand a company’s “report card.”

**Focus on:**

* **Income statement** — revenue, expenses, net income.
* **Balance sheet** — assets, liabilities, equity.
* **Cash flow statement** — operating, investing, financing flows.

**Tool:** Yahoo Finance → download annual/quarterly reports of 2 companies and compare.

---

## **Step 4: Study Investment Vehicles & Strategies** *(4–6 weeks)*

**Types of investing:**

* **Index investing** — low-cost, passive approach.
* **Value investing** — buying undervalued companies (Buffett style).
* **Growth investing** — targeting high-growth companies.
* **Dividend investing** — focusing on income.
* **Swing / position trading** — shorter-term trades using technical analysis.

---

## **Step 5: Practice in a Risk-Free Environment** *(2–3 months)*

Before putting real money on the line:

* Use a **stock simulator** (Investopedia Simulator, MarketWatch Virtual Stock Exchange).
* Set an imaginary budget (e.g., \$10,000) and build a portfolio.
* Track your results and write a short weekly reflection: “What worked? What failed?”

---

## **Step 6: Start Small with Real Money**

* Open a **low-cost brokerage account**.
* Start with **index ETFs** (e.g., S\&P 500 ETF) for diversification.
* Invest only **what you can afford to lose** — treat it as tuition.

---

## **Step 7: Build a Long-Term Discipline**

* Review your portfolio quarterly.
* Keep an **investment journal** (document every decision and reason).
* Read 1 investing book every 2 months (e.g., *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* by Philip Fisher).

---

💡 **Pro tip for speeding up learning:**
I can design an **n8n automation** that pulls:

* Stock price updates from APIs.
* Company news summaries.
* Earnings dates alerts.

This way you’ll train your decision-making using **real-time data like a professional manager**.

If you want, I can map this into a **12-month professional investor learning plan** with weekly tasks so you steadily progress without getting overwhelmed.
